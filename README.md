## Projects Overview

This repository includes the following deep learning projects:
1. **Image Segmentation:** Semantic segmentation using fully convolutional networks (FCNs).
2. **Simple GAN:** Basic implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks.
3. **Neural Style Transfer (NST):** Combining content from one image and style from another using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Project Details

### 1. Image Segmentation
This project involves implementing an image segmentation model using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The model takes an input image and outputs pixel-wise classification to segment different objects in the image.

### 2. Simple GAN
In this project, we build a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new images from random noise. The network is trained using adversarial learning to produce realistic-looking images.

### 3. Neural Style Transfer (NST)
This project demonstrates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for transferring the style of one image onto another image's content. The NST model leverages a pretrained VGG network.

- **Libraries:** PyTorch
